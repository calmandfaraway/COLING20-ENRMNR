Abstract: 

```
News retrieval is the task to return a ranked list of news articles related to a query. Previous studies were primarily concentrated towards the relevance between the query and news articles at the level of individual news articles, despite the fact that those news articles in response to the query are frequently presented as events. Consequently, these studies usually fail to satisfy the event-oriented information needs of users. 
In this paper, we propose a novel and effective event-oriented neural ranking model for news retrieval, namely ENRMNR. Our model exploits the characteristics of events (i.e., dynamics and cohesion) to rerank retrieval results of news articles for event-oriented queries. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms competitive models.

### Dataset

#### 1. Event-Dataset

Event-Dataset from paper 'Event-Dataset: Temporal information retrieval and text classification dataset'. The Event-Dataset contains relevant and non-relevant news articles for 35 popular events. The news articles are annotated by human annotators into relevant and irrelevant classes, providing rational for their judgment. 

#### 2. JustEvents

JustEvents from paper 'JustEvents: A Crowdsourced Corpus for Event Validation with Strict Temporal Constraints'.  The dataset consists of 250 events and 6,457 candidate documents used as a base for assessing event occurrence .
